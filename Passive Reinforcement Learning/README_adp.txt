PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
-------------------
This script reads all trajectories (.pkl files) that were generated by trajectory.py and then uses adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) to compute the utilities of each state

We average out rewards received at each state using a count of the number of times the state was visited. 
We then estimate transition probabilities (T) using the trajectories. This is done as a count of number of times a transition occured divided by the number of times the action
was executed from the given state.

Then we set up a system of linear equations in U, using Bellman's equations.
This is then solved using Python's numpy linear algebra library. 
The utilities are then printed out on stdout.
