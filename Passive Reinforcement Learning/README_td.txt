PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
-------------------
This script reads all trajectories (.pkl files) that were generated by trajectory.py and then uses Temporal Difference Learning (TD) to compute the utilities of each state

We examine each transition in the trajectory and use a learning parameter (alpha) which is defined as the inverse of the number of times a state was visited.
The single update equation for this method (for a transition from s to s'), is:

U(s) = U(s) + alpha * (R(s) + U(s') - U(s))

The estimated utilities are then printed out on stdout.
