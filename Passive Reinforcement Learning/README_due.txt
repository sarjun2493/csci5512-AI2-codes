(3, 1) 0.63652173913
(4, 1) 0.432727272727
(1, 2) 0.778666666667
(3, 2) 0.83724137931
(1, 3) 0.834567901235
(2, 3) 0.895308641975
(3, 3) 0.943636363636


PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
-------------------
This script reads all trajectories (.pkl files) that were generated by trajectory.py and then uses direct utility estimation to compute the utilities at each state
In short, we compute utilities as the continuing reward of going to a terminal node from a current state.
We then average it out over all occurences of the initial point and report it to stdout.
